This is a group project done with me and a classmate, in EECS 3401, Introduction to Artificial Intellgience and Logic Programming. 
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on a large dataset to deeply analyze trends, frequency counts, and correlations between different variables
- Manually preprocessed data by removing irrelevant variables and fixing missing values to ensure the dataset has the most accurate data to avoid inconsistent or incorrect results
- Applied three different machine learning algorithms to the dataset and performed analysis on the results to determine the best model
- Wrote a technical report regarding findings, successes, things to improve on
